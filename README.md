`pcl:x64-windows 1.15.0`

`pcl[visualization]:x64-windows`

## How to run

Firstly, it is necessary to configure the environment according to the requirements [window构建FCL库.md](https://github.com/whsleep/fcl_trial/blob/main/1.%20install/window%E6%9E%84%E5%BB%BAFCL%E5%BA%93.md)

Then create a new project and add each chapter's code separately to the project.

Finally, run demo *. cpp to complete the process.
